This particular repo is just to learn the Flutter basics.

To install Flutter we need to download it from its official website along with android studio and of course git.

Once flutter zip is ready, we need to unzip it in C:\src folder for windows users (in some cases will be necessary to create a src folder) following up we need to add a new flutter env variable to our system that targets the flutter bin folder from the "path" user env option. Is highly reccomended to run the "flutter doctor" command on the windows terminal to ensure our installation was successfully either way, if get some warnings about "cmdline-tools component is missing" is necessary to run android studio - customize/All settings/System settings/Android SDK/SDK Tools tab, then check the Android SDK command line tools option and press the apply button, To handle licenses warnings run "flutter doctor --android-licenses" command.
